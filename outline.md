__This Black Forest Cake__ is my version of the famous German chocolate cake, aka “Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte.” It has 4 chocolatey layers, 1 lb of kirsch-infused cherries and a light whipped cream.

It is a stunning and decadent cake but _it’s fairly simple to make with just 11 ingredients_ (which is peanuts for a cake!). The chocolate shavings make this Black Forest cake
